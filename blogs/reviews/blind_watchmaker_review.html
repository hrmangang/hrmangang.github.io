							<h1>A crictical appreciation of Richard Dawkin's the Blind Watchmaker.</h1>
							<p>Richard Dawkins’s third book published more than 30 years ago not only features a rich content of a bird’s eye view of evolutionary biology but also a catching and fitting name. It apparently comes from the watchmaker analogy made famous by William Paley. The watchmaker analogy is an argument which states that a design implies a designer. Especially for an intelligent design, there must be an intelligent designer, which many people wish to call “God” or “deity”. In fact, this argument has played a prominent role in natural theology and it has been extensively used by theists and theologians to provide support for the existence of God. This analogy, though very commonsensical, has an enormous hole in it as we can see that it is an inductive approach which has no solid proof apart from the fact that many things we see in life are created by something or somebody.</p>
							<p>Dawkins is both an evolutionary biologist and atheist, which also explains that he uses ideas of evolution to refute the idea of the existence of God or the grand watchmaker. In fact, this book probably performed better in convincing the readers that there is indeed no God than his other slightly immature book “The God Delusion”. As it was mentioned above, William Paley held that the complexity of living organsims was a direct evidence of the existence of a creator which is in parallel with the way in which the existence of a watch implies the existence of an intelligent watchmaker. Dawkins dispels this idea pointing out the no-goal or no-purpose attitude of natural selection which has been crafting, for no reason, millions of species that exist today. So, if we go by Paley’s idea, we can also say that natural selection is the watchmaker and the prefix “blind” refers to the fact that selection does not plan anything ahead and it is only a local phenomenon which just happens. If the purpose of this book is to give an overview of evolution and convey to its readers that natural selection, not some divine being, is the watchmaker and the one who is responsible for every life we see today, then this book has fulfilled its purpose and succeeded tremendously. In conveying his ideas, Dawkins uses a rather simplistic tone of language which would appeal even to non-scientific minds and has used analogies whenever he can to explain and convince his readers.</p>
							<p>Some theists and believers would be convinced or at least pleased with the logical explanation that selection is the cause of their creation, however they would still be happy to hold on to their age-old belief in the supernatural all-knowing God. Many of us has fear of stepping out of comfort zone and are happy to be in the crowd. But, the book has succeeded in conveying that not all of our age-old beliefs are true and many of the questions and mysteries of the universe and the living world are better explained with an open-mind and a logical quest rather than just putting the cause of it on to God’s shoulders.</p>
							<p>To explain the idea of complexity being created by the “blind” selection, the author uses the example of the eye. He begins with a simple organism, which has a eye capable of only distinguishing between light and dark. With time this eye can gain and accumulate minor changes to its structure and function. After sufficient time and accumulation, we arrive at a profound eye capable of myriad of abilities which, to a casual sight-seer, demands an immediate explanation and owing to its complexity, many people just declared there must have been an intelligent creator and they call the “God”.</p>
							<p>In almost every chapter, the author has put excerpts from revelant books and articles to explain his ideas. In the preface, he has stated that he wrote the book “to persuade the reader, not just that the Darwinian world-view happens to be true, but that it is the only known theory that could, in principle, solve the mystery our existence.” In chapter 1, he explains that biology is the study of complex things, as he also considers life as a complex machine. He then sets up to explain the complexity of life using a seemingly simple concept of “natural selection”. In the very first line of chapter 2, he states that “natural selection is the blind watchmaker, blind because it does not see ahead, does not plan consequences, has no purpose in view.” He hails this as an impressive design which has misguided many individuals to believe in some supernatural creator. In chapter 3, he argues that a species is a result of accumulation of minor modifications, and it is not achieved in a single-step. Sadly, it has taken millions and millions of years to have arrived at the millions of species we see today and modern humans are too young to actually notice the course of evolution. In the subsequent chapters, he gives several examples illustrating
the idea of “descent of modification”. As we advance through the chapters, especially chapter 5 and 6, it gets a little harder to general non-scientific people to grasp but that is understandable. A lot of ideas focusing on the significance of DNA and its role in determining and crafting species have been discussed. In chapter 7, the author claims that there is “constructive evolution” and not all evolutions are destructive, i.e., wipe out organisms with unpreferable traits. He has stated that “genes are selected, not for their intrinsic qualities, but by virtue of their interactions with their environment.” Toward the end of the book, he argues against the existence of God, stating that “a deity capable of engineering all the organized complexity in the world ... must already have been vastly complex ...” He refers to the idea of God as “postulating organized complexity without offering an explanation.”</p>
							<p>The book maintains more or less the same friendly tone throughout which it started with. The preface and the first chapter serves as a perfect introduction to biology for ordinary layman. One may argue that it has a large number of excerpts and examples that sometimes make the scientific ideas expressed messy rather than provide simplification. Some readers might get outraged as Dawkins has attempted “to persuade” people that evolution is a better explanation of the complexity of life than “God”, as much as atheists are delighted to have a perfect companion which they would be proud to share or recommend to fellow theists and church people. In some parts of the book, Dawkins sounded more like a “metaphysician” than a “biologist”. Overall, it is a brave book which has attempted to educate the world of the truth while knowing that it will inevitably face a lot of criticisms from some sections of the readers.
